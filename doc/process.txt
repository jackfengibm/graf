# Adding Code
###
Before adding code, the developer needs to review the files and indiviual changes:
  1) git status
  2) git diff - Look at the individual code changes and ensure every line is required (e.g. no debug stmts)
  3) git add <files>
  4) git commit -m "<Intelligent message of what is being commited>"

# General Code Guidelines
###
The following are general guidelines for writing GRAF Code:
  1) Before adding a feature or fixing a bug, create a branch for your work
  2) Keep methods short, between 5-7 lines each
  3) Before writing any code, write the test for that code
  4) Only write enough code to make your test pass
