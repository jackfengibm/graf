# General Code Guidelines
###
The following are general guidelines for writing GRAF Code:
  1) Before adding a feature or fixing a bug, create a branch for your work
  2) Keep methods short, between 5-7 lines each
  3) Before writing any code, write the test for that code
  4) Only write enough code to make your test pass

###
# Adding Code
###
Before adding code, the developer needs to review the files and indiviual changes:
  1) git status
  2) git diff - Look at the individual code changes and ensure every line is required (e.g. no debug stmts)
  3) git branch - Make sure you're adding to a local branch...NOT MASTER
  3) git add <files>
  4) git commit -m "<Intelligent message of what is being commited>"

###
# New Changes in New Branch Going to Master
###
1) Create new branch
  - git checkout -b <branch-name>
2) Make changes and commit to branch
  - git commit -a -m "<commit>"

3) Merge changes into master
  - git checkout master
  - git merge <branch-name>

4) Push master to remote
  - git push

###
# Pulling Changes in Master to Local Branch
###
1) Switch to local master branch
  - git checkout master

2) Pull down changes from remote
  - git pull

3) Merge changes from local master into local branch
  - git checkout <branch-name>
  - git merge master
